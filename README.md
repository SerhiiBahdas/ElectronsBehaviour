# ElectronsBehaviour
The program is written simulates electrons behavior in the field effect transistor. 
Builds 3d graphs of potential relief and electric field picture. 
It also builds the volt-ampere characteristic. 
All comments are written on Ukrainian, so you can use Google Translator to easily know what 
I wanted to say dropping a comment. If you want to get the animation of electrons behavior 
simulation you can run an additional file named "cartoon", which will provide you images of model 
particles positions, obtained on each time step. You can then easily use programs which creating .gif files, 
for example, PicGif to create an animation. If open particles.gif, you will see the simulation of model 
particles behavior in 2d transistor (source is on the bottom left, drain is on the bottom right and gate is 
in the middle of the bottom).
